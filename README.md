# XMPP Web

## Usage

    npm install
    npm start

## Road map

- Messaging
- Group messages by day in the list, some form of infinite scrolling
- Roster functionality (but without groups)
- Status/vCard management (only status text and nickname/photo)
- Announce active/inactive/composing activity
- Persist data in localStorage
- Desktop notifications and sounds

## Nice to haves but probably far off

- Message Carbons
- Message Archive Management
- OTR support. For now maybe a lock button with tooltip "For end-to-end encryption, install a desktop client"
